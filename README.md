# Dog Breed Classifier
This is the capstone project for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program, where I developed a convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify dog breeds using PyTorch and transfer learning.
Based on a picture of a dog, an algorithm will give an estimate of the breed of the dog. If the image of a person is given, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
